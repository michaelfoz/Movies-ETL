# Movies-ETL (UCD Module 8)
### Please read: 
#### (1) For my first attempt, I uploadeded Deliverable's 1 and 2 in Folders named "Deliverable 1," and "Deliverable 2" but for this attempt, I uploaded all of my files into the default directory outside of the folders I initally uploaded them into.  Please view ETL_function_test.ipynb, ETL_clean_wiki_movies.ipynb, ETL_clean_kaggle_data.ipynb and ETL_create_database.ipynb in the default directory.
#### (2) In my resources folder, I only have movies_query.png and ratings_query.png; I was unable to upload movies_metadata.csv and wikipedia_movies.json. When I was trying to upload movies_metadata.csv and wikipedia_movies.json, Github gave me the error message: "Yowza, that's a big file. Try again with a file smaller than 25MB."  (Please view my screen shot) and please let me know how I can upload these larger files onto my repository.)
#### (3) At first I was having trouble when I performed a query on the ratings table; I received 52,048,527 rows.  I realized that this was double of 26,024,289 because I did not follow the hint provided ("Hint: Use 'replace' for the if_exists parameter").  I had to run my code again in order to get the correct value.
